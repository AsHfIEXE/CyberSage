## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

CyberSage V2 follows a modular, multi-component architecture:

1.  **Flask Backend (`app.py`):**
    *   Serves the web interface and API endpoints.
    *   Orchestrates the scan workflow by calling individual tool modules.
    *   Manages database interactions (SQLite via `sqlite3`).
    *   Handles real-time progress updates via SSE.
2.  **Tool Modules (`tools/`):**
    *   Each Python file (e.g., `recon.py`, `scan.py`, `vuln_scan.py`) encapsulates logic for running specific categories of security tools.
    *   `common.py` provides shared utilities like command execution and configuration loading.
3.  **Configuration (`config/tools.yaml`):**
    *   Externalizes tool paths, API keys, and operational parameters, allowing for easy customization without code changes.
4.  **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**
    *   `templates/` contains Jinja2 HTML templates for the user interface.
    *   `static/` serves CSS (Tailwind via CDN) and client-side JavaScript for interactivity and SSE handling.
5.  **Database (SQLite):**
    *   Stores scan metadata, raw outputs (optional/links), parsed results from tools, and AI summaries.
6.  **External Security Tools:**
    *   The suite of open-source tools that perform the actual security assessment tasks. CyberSage V2 acts as an orchestrator and data aggregator for these tools.

## üß∞ Core Toolset

CyberSage V2 integrates the following open-source tools (ensure they are installed and correctly configured in `config/tools.yaml`):

*   **Reconnaissance:**
    *   `Subfinder`: Subdomain discovery.
    *   `HTTPX` (ProjectDiscovery): Fast HTTP/HTTPS probing and tech detection.
    *   `Katana`: Advanced crawling and spidering.
    *   `Dirsearch`: Directory and file brute-forcing.
*   **Scanning:**
    *   `Nmap`: Network exploration and port scanning.
    *   `testssl.sh`: Comprehensive SSL/TLS scanner.
    *   `WhatWeb`: Web technology identification.
    *   `Nikto`: Web server vulnerability scanning.
*   **Vulnerability Assessment:**
    *   `Nuclei`: Template-based vulnerability scanning.
    *   `Dalfox`: Parameter analysis and XSS scanning.
    *   `SQLMap`: SQL injection detection and exploitation (basic checks implemented).
*   **Exploit Information:**
    *   `SearchSploit`: Exploit database lookup (currently for reference).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get CyberSage V2 up and running on your system (Debian/Ubuntu based Linux recommended):

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` and `venv`
*   Go 1.19+ (with `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` in your system `PATH`)
*   Git, Curl, Wget
*   Standard build tools (`build-essential`, `pkg-config`, etc.)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CyberSageV2.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd CyberSageV2
    ```

2.  **Run the Installation Script:**
    This script attempts to install system dependencies, Go tools, and clones Git-based tools.
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    ```
     –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ review the output. Some tools might require manual path configuration or dependency resolution.
    **After running `install.sh`, RESTART YOUR TERMINAL or source your shell profile (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`) for PATH changes to take effect.**

3.  **Verify Tool Paths & Configure API Keys:**
    *   Open `config/tools.yaml`.
    *   **Crucially, update `tool_paths` with the correct absolute paths** to your installed tools if they are not found via system `PATH`. This is especially important for Go binaries (e.g., `httpx`, `nuclei`) and tools cloned into specific directories (e.g., `/opt/testssl.sh/testssl.sh`).
    *   Add your OpenRouter.ai API key to `openai_api_key` to enable AI summarization features.

4.  **Set Up Python Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Ensure httpx CLI extras for Python's httpx library (if used by any dependency, though we aim for PD's httpx)
    # pip install "httpx[cli,http2]" --upgrade # Typically handled by requirements if specified
    ```

### Running CyberSage V2

1.  **Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
2.  **Start the Flask Application:**
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```
3.  **Access in Browser:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## üìñ Usage Guide

1.  **Initiate a Scan:**
    *   On the main page (`/`), enter the target domain (e.g., `example.com`) or a full URL (e.g., `http://testphp.vulnweb.com`).
    *   Click "Start Scan".
2.  **Monitor Progress:**
    *   Scan progress will be displayed in real-time on the same page, showing updates from each tool stage.
    *   The scan ID will also be displayed.
3.  **View Results:**
    *   Once the scan completes, the "Start Scan" button will change to "View Results". Clicking it will take you to the detailed results page for that scan (`/results/<scan_id>`).
    *   The results page features:
        *   Overall scan summary and AI-generated insights.
        *   Vulnerability severity distribution chart.
        *   Tabbed sections for detailed findings from each tool category (Reconnaissance, Scanning, Web Server, SSL/TLS, Exploits, and a consolidated Vulnerabilities table).
        *   Interactive filtering for the main vulnerabilities table.
        *   Modal pop-ups for viewing full details of individual vulnerabilities.

## üîß Troubleshooting

*   **`Tool Not Found` / `command not found`:**
    *   Verify `install.sh` completed successfully for the specific tool.
    *   **Ensure the absolute path to the tool's executable is correctly specified in `config/tools.yaml` under `tool_paths`.**
    *   For Go tools, ensure `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable and that this `PATH` is active in the terminal session running `python3 app.py`.
*   **HTTPX Flag Errors (`No such option: -l / -list / -jsonl`):**
    *   This strongly indicates that the system is finding Python's `httpx` CLI wrapper instead of ProjectDiscovery's Go-based `httpx`.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure `tool_paths.httpx` in `config/tools.yaml` points to the *absolute path* of your ProjectDiscovery `httpx` binary (e.g., `/home/youruser/go/bin/httpx`). Reinstall it with `go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest` if unsure. Manually test the binary with `-list <file>` and `-jsonl` flags.
*   **Dirsearch/Nikto/SQLMap not found or errors:**
    *   Ensure they were cloned by `install.sh` to the directories specified in `config/tools.yaml` (`/opt/...`).
    *   Dirsearch might need its Python dependencies installed: `cd /opt/dirsearch && sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    *   Nikto requires Perl.
*   **Flask `BuildError` for `url_for('...')`:** A route for the specified endpoint is missing in `app.py`, or there's a typo in the `url_for` call within an HTML template. Check HTML comments too, as Jinja processes them.
*   **Python `NameError` or `AttributeError` in `.py` files:** Usually typos or scope issues. Check the traceback from the Flask console carefully.
*   **UI Data Not Displaying:**
    *   Check Flask console logs for errors during tool execution or data fetching in `app.py`'s `results_page`.
    *   Inspect the raw tool output files in `~/.cybersage_v2/tool_outputs_raw/`.
    *   Verify data is being correctly stored in `~/.cybersage_v2/cybersage_v2.db` (you can use an SQLite browser).
    *   Check browser console for JavaScript errors on the results page.
